# Prokaryotic transcriptome analysis
Welcome!!! This is a brief introduction to RNA-seq analysis of prokaryotes. The key thing to take away from this is that prokaryotes do not perform alternative splicing like eukaryotes. We will analyze the activation of competence in Streptococcus sinensis to learn how to analyze prokaryotic RNA-seq data. Competence is a physiological phenomena that occurs in certain bacteria where they can uptake and integrate exogenous DNA from the environment into a bacteria genome. This phenomena is how certain bacteria can acquire antibiotic resistance genes from different species of bacteria. The competence phenomena is regulated by quorum sensing, which is chemical communication method bacteria use.
- The genome data can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_019090945.2/
- The SRA numbers for RNA-seq data are: SRR11954369, SRR11954371, SRR11954372, SRR11954374
- You can fastq-dump or fasterq-dump to download the RNA-seq data.
