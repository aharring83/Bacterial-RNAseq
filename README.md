# Prokaryotic transcriptome analysis
Welcome!!! This is a brief introduction to RNA-seq analysis of prokaryotes. The key thing to take away from this is that prokaryotes do not perform alternative splicing like eukaryotes. We will analyze the activation of competence in Streptococcus sinensis to learn how to analysis prokaryotic RNA-seq data. 
The genome data can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_019090945.2/
The SRA numbers for RNA-seq data are: SRR11954369, SRR11954371, SRR11954372, SRR11954374

You can fastq-dump or fasterq-dump to download the RNA-seq data.
